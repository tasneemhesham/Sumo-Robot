- **IR Sensors**: For precise opponent detection and edge detection.
- **Motors**: For driving the robot’s movement with agility and power.
- **Custom 3D Printed Body**: Enhances performance and durability by providing a robust and optimized structure.

## Programming
- **Language**: Arduino C++
- **Functionality**:
  - Developed custom code for precise control and integration of sensors.
  - Implemented algorithms for strategic maneuvering and detection.
  - Optimized movement strategies for agility and power in competitive settings.

## Robot Functionality
- **Sensor Integration**: Utilized ultrasonic and IR sensors for accurate opponent detection and edge sensing.
- **Movement Optimization**: Programmed to ensure robust performance with precise control over motors, achieving a balance of speed and power.
- **Competitive Performance**: Engineered to handle various competitive scenarios with strategic decision-making capabilities.

## Outcomes
- **Achievement**: 1st place in the Sumo competition.
- **Performance**: The robot demonstrated exceptional performance in both detection and strategic maneuvering, highlighting the team's commitment to innovation and technical proficiency.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Assemble the Robot**:
   - Mount ultrasonic and IR sensors on the robot’s chassis.
